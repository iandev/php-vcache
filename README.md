php-vcache
==========

Generic light weight PHP page caching tool for generating and serving static HTML documents (with gzip compression). Perfect for high traffic blogging websites or for websites that don't have to serve constantly updating or time critical content.
## Usage:

Place this in your index.php or wherever your application root is.  This was tested with wordpress by entering this code in the index.php file and substituting the commented section below (/*your PHP application starting point here*/) with the original wordpress index.php code.

```php
include "cache.php";

//for gzip support, change this to GzipFileRepository
use \ViewCache\FileRepository as Repository;
use \ViewCache\BufferedCache as Cache;
use \ViewCache\FileExpirationCachePolicy as CachePolicy1;
use \ViewCache\HttpMethodCachePolicy as CachePolicy2;
use \ViewCache\UriRegexCachePolicy as CachePolicy3;
use \ViewCache\FileLogger as Logger;
use \ViewCache\LogType as LogType;

$key = $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
$expiration_seconds = 30;
$cache_dir = "cachedir";

$logger = Logger::instance("vcache-error.log");
$repository = new Repository($cache_dir);
$cache = new Cache(
  array(
    //cache pages for specific amount of seconds
    new CachePolicy1($repository, $expiration_seconds), 
    //only cache pages using certain http method calls
    new CachePolicy2(array("GET"=>array("allowed"=>true))),
    //only cache pages that match the request uri
    new CachePolicy3(array("/p=1/", "/p=2/"))
  ), 
  $repository,
  $logger
);

$page_contents = $cache->get($key);
if($page_contents == null || empty($page_contents)) {
  $cache->bufferStart();
  
  /*
    your PHP application starting point here
  */
  
  $page_contents = $cache->bufferGetEndSave($key);
}

echo $page_contents;
```
